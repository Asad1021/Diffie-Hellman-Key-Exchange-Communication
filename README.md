# Secure Communication Program

The Secure Communication Program is a simple demonstration of secure communication between two parties using symmetric key encryption. It utilizes randomly generated prime numbers to compute secure keys, ensuring the confidentiality of exchanged information. The program provides a visually appealing interface for an enhanced user experience.

## Key Features

- Random prime number generation: The program generates large prime numbers as the foundation for secure key computation.
- Secure key computation: Using the generated prime numbers, secure keys are calculated, providing a strong cryptographic basis for communication.
- File encryption and decryption: The program allows for the encryption and decryption of files using symmetric key encryption.
- Visual enhancements: The program incorporates visual elements such as screen clearing, color changes, headings, messages, and progress indicators for a more engaging user interface.

## Usage

1. Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions.
2. Enter private numbers for both parties to generate public keys and compute a shared symmetric key.
3. The program encrypts a file named "input.txt" using the symmetric key and saves it as "encrypted.txt".
4. Simulate file transfer and decryption by the recipient to obtain the decrypted file, saved as "decrypted.txt".

Please note that this program is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world secure communication scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Secure Communication Program, clone the repository and compile the code using a C compiler. Ensure that the necessary libraries (such as Windows.h) are installed and accessible on your system.

## Customization

Feel free to explore the code and customize it to suit your specific requirements. You can enhance the program's functionality, improve the user interface, or integrate it into a larger project.
